    <p><span> W  </span>    hen you think of NASA, most people think of the astronauts, but there's a lot more to the organization. To accomplish NASA's basic mission, they need people to develop and build new technologies, assemble and test spacecraft and their components, train astronauts/pilots and provide mission support services. With each task, there are workers to employ and pay, contractors to hire and supplies to purchase. NASA requires an enormous work force (over 18,000 employees and 40,000 contractors) and a large budget ($17.3 billion estimated for fiscal year 2008). NASA must have an infrastructure to deliver goods and services and account for the money spent. </p>

    <p> NASA's organizational structure has changed over the decades to make the administration more efficient and to adapt to changes in its direction/priorities in the post-Apollo era. NASA's current organizational structure reflects a strategic plan formulated in 2006 to carry out the goals set forth in President George W. Bush's 2004 Vision for Space Exploration). NASA has four main offices, or directorates, through which it works to accomplish its goals:</p>
    
    <ul> 
        <li> <b>Aeronautics Research </b> - conduct research and development for safe, reliable flight vehicles and aviation systems</li>
    <li> <b> Exploration Systems</b> - develop technologies to support human and robotic exploration of space  - develop technologies to support human and robotic exploration of space</li>
    <li> <b> Science</b>explore Earth, sun, solar system and universe through missions that are proposed by principal investigators (scientists) within both NASA and academia</li>
    <li> <b> Space Op- direct launches, operations and communications for all spacecraft both in Earth orbit and beyonderations </b> - direct launches, operations and communications for all spacecraft both in Earth orbit and beyond</li></ul>
    <p> The mission directorates are located in NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. and form the core of NASA's efforts. Each office coordinates activities within various NASA centers across the country to achieve its responsibilities.</p>
